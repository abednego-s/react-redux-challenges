# Challenge 04 - createEntityAdapter

## Run the app

`npm run dev ./src/04-createEntityAdapter`

## Description

A straightforward CRUD book app. Within the form, you'll encounter a text input field alongside an "Add" button. Upon clicking the "Add" button, a new book item will appear on the list, its title derived from the value entered into the text input. Each book item on the list is equipped with an input checkbox and a "Delete" button. The checkbox, when clicked, toggles between checked and unchecked states. Furthermore, clicking the "Delete" button will remove the respective item from the list.

## Run the test

`npm run test ./src/04-createEntityAdapter`
