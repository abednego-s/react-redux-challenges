# Challenge 04 - createEntityAdapter

## Run the app

`npm run dev ./src/04-createEntityAdapter`

## Description

A simple CRUD book app. A text input field and a "Add" button can be found on the form. When you click the "Add" button, a new book item will be added to the list, with a title derived from the value you entered in the text input. Each book on the list has a checkbox for input and a "Delete" button. When you click the checkbox, it toggles between checked and unchecked states and marks the book item as read. Additionally, clicking the "Delete" button will remove the item from the list.

## Run the test

`npm run test ./src/04-createEntityAdapter`
