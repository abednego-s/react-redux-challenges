# Challenge 02 - createReducer

## Run the app

`npm run dev ./src/02-createReducer`

## Description

Build a simple Todo. There is an input text field and a "Add" button on the form. Filling out the input text and clicking the "Add" button will add a new task to the list. Each todo item will have a checkbox and a delete button; clicking the checkbox toggles the check / unchecked state; clicking the delete button removes the item from the list.

Note: Reducer functions should be created using `createReducer`.

## Run the test

`npm run test ./src/02-createReducer`
