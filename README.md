# React Redux Challenges

## About

This coding challenge has been curated to assess your proficiency with the Redux library. Make this project to evaluate your understanding of common use-cases, as well as your familiarity with the various functions and utilities offered by Redux. Each challenge is accompanied by detailed instructions and corresponding unit test code that must be successfully passed. I believe that engaging with these challenges will significantly enhance your learning experience.

Inside the `src` folder, navigates to each challenges and look into the README file for the instructions on how to run, implement and test the code.

Should you have any suggestions on how we can refine or improve these challenges to better cater to your learning needs, I welcome your input. Your success in this coding challenge is not just a measure of your current skills, but also an opportunity for growth and improvement. I wish you the best of luck, and feel free to reach out with any questions or feedback.
