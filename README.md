# React Redux Challenges

A collection of coding challenges to test your knowledge of Redux. Use this project to assess your understanding of common use-cases as well as your familiarity with Redux's various functions and utilities. Each challenge comes with detailed instructions and corresponding unit test code that must be passed. You can modify or add the tests if you want since the main purpose is to understanding the key concepts of Redux.

Feel free to reach out if you have any suggestions on how I can refine or improve these challenges to better cater to your learning needs.
